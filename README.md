**This repository is a collection of three projects I completed while learning the ins and outs of Docker. Through these projects, I explored concepts like Dockerfiles, images, containers, Docker Compose, watch mode, and Docker Scout.**

**What you'll find here:**

* Three individual project folders, each dedicated to a separate Dockerized application.
* A main README.md file (this one) summarizing the overall learning journey and key takeaways.

**Key Learnings:**

* Dockerfiles: I learned how to write Dockerfiles, the blueprints for building container images. Mastering FROM, COPY, RUN, and other instructions allowed me to define application environments and dependencies within these images.
* Docker Images: I gained an understanding of the importance of building and managing Docker images. These images ensure consistent and isolated application execution across different environments.
* Docker Containers: I explored the concept of containers, lightweight and isolated units running specific applications. I learned how to start, stop, and manage containers efficiently.
* Docker Compose: I discovered the power of Docker Compose, which simplifies multi-container applications by defining services and their relationships in a single file.
* Docker Compose Watch: I delved into watch mode, allowing automatic container rebuilds and restarts when code changes are detected, boosting development efficiency.
* Docker Scout: I experimented with Docker Scout, a visualization tool that provides insights into container resource usage and performance.
